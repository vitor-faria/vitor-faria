I'm a ISFJ generalist with a Bachelor degree in Chemical Engineering by Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (🇧🇷) and a volunteer work background, who became interested in data analysis, manipulation and visualization through Excel and has recently shifted to a career in **Data Science & Analytics**. 

Currently based in Belo Horizonte, working with data and pursuing a Master of Science in Data Science.

## 👨‍🔬 Projects, Notebooks & Articles

### TeraBeer (PT/🇧🇷)

Recommending system of brazilian craft beers based on the user's taste for food and beverages. This was the final project of Tera's bootcamp of Data Science &
