# Hi, it's Vitor 👋

I'm a ISFJ generalist with a Bachelor degree in Chemical Engineering by Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (Belo Horizonte 🇧🇷) and a volunteer work background, who became interested in data analysis, manipulation and visualization through Excel and has recently shifted to a career in **Data Science & Analytics**. 

Currently based in Belo Horizonte, working with data and pursuing a Master of Science in Data Science.

## 🧑‍💻 Work Experience

### Data Analyst @ Platos Educação (2019-current)

> Platos is part of the holding Cogna Educação, one of the world's leading educational organizations, and serves the B2B Higher Education market. The company 
> offers, under the brand Saraiva Educação, a range of educational services and solutions for higher education institutions across the country, such as digital 
> libraries, digital learning environments and online preparation for exams.
> In our Data Science, Engineering and Analytics team, I:
> - build Machine Learning models for customer segmentation and book recommendation;
> - create interactive dashboards for Product, Marketing, Customer Success and Sales teams using Metabase as BI & ad-hoc platform;
> - automate reports for internal and external use with Python (Django, Pandas and Matplotlib);
> - create, maintain and optimize ETL pipelines to ingest data in our Google BigQuery Data Warehouse;
> - provide on-demand business and product insights based on Exploratory Data Analysis;
> - play a protagonist role in spreading the data-driven culture along the company.

### BI Intern @ Somos Educação (2018-2019)

> SOMOS was (when aquired by Kroton) the largest group of basic education in Brazil and impacted more than 27 million students across Brazil through various brands. 
> My role as BI Intern in the Business Unit of Solutions for Higher and Technical Education was to:
> - Create BI dashboards in order to keep track of the top OKR's;
> - Provide business insights to the leaders;
> - Use Data Storytelling to build visuals and slides for Radar meetings;
> - Develop processes to improve Knowledge Management.

### Junior Entrepreneur @ Mult Jr (2015-2017)

> Mult Jr is a Junior Enterprise voluntarily managed by Chemical Engineering students that provides solutions under the technical guidance of Professors from the
University. And it is where I fell in love with Excel spreadsheets and Data Analysis, while working in the Financial and HR departments.

## 🧑‍🎓 Education

### Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp @ Tera

> Tera is a modern school focused on Project Based Learning with Market experts of the Digital Economy. In this challenging 6-month bootcamp, me and my group 
developed and launched the TeraBeer project - a recommending system of brazilian craft beers based on the user's taste for food and beverages.

### B.Sc. in Chemical Engineering @ UFMG

> The Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais graduates engineers capable of acting in the most diverse areas of the 
chemical industry, such as food & beverages, paper & pulp, petrochemical, among others. All the professors are PhDs in the university and the main focuses are 
in Transport Phenomena, Thermodynamics, Kinetics & Reactor Design and Unit Operations. During university years I was engaged in different extracurricular 
activities:

#### Automation & Simulation Summer School @ RTWH Aachen 🇩🇪

> The Summer Schools are courses provided by the International Academy of the RWTH Aachen University targeting Engineering students of outstanding academic 
> performance from all over the world. The program of the 4-week Automation and Simulation course gather many activities, such as lectures and exercises about 
> Nummerical Methods in Matlab and Robot Automation, classes about german language and culture, visits to state of the art german companies, excursions and 
> intercultural training. The course took place during the month of July, 2019.

#### Academic Exchange @ FAU Erlangen 🇩🇪

> 1 semester academic exchange at Friedrich-Alexander Universität through the program Minas Mundi (UFMG), from April 2018 to August 2018. All lessons were taught 
> in German.
> Language courses: Deutsch Intensivkurs C1.1 (March 2018, 5 ECTS), Deutsch Allgemeinkurs C1 (April to July 2018, 5 ECTS) - Sprachzentrum.

#### Volunteer @ Equalizar

> Founded in 2012, Equalizar is a social project based at the Engineering School of UFMG that provides low-cost preparation for ENEM, the exam used to enter most 
> public and private universities, helping vulnerable students from the public system to change their lives. Equalizar is totally managed by volunteers and helps 
> +100 students every year.
> I worked voluntarily at Equalizar between 2014 and 2016 in different positions such as Math monitor, HR assistant and Communication director.

#### Scientific Initiation @ CDTN

> 1-year Scientific Initiation at Centro de Desenvolvimento de Tecnologia Nuclear, working on the project *"Obtaining Graphene and Graphene Oxide in Aqueous 
> Environment for Contaminant Adsorption"* together with doctoral students. The aim of the project is to optimize graphene extraction by the exfoliation method 
> in the liquid phase using water as solvent and to study the use of graphene oxides to clean water contaminated with radioactive substances by the adsorption 
> method.
