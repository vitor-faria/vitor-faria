## 👨‍🔬 Projects, Notebooks & Articles

### Wikinator: an Akinator-like game based on DBPedia's Knowledge Graph (EN/🇺🇸)

Final project for the module of Semantic Web Technologies / Knowledge Graphs, as part of the program Mannheim Master in Data Science of the University of Mannheim, during the winter semester of 2022/23. It is a game application inspired in Akinator, that tries to guess which real world person or fictional character the players are thinking of, but relying solely on data available in DBPedia's Knowledge Graph and SPARQL queries.
